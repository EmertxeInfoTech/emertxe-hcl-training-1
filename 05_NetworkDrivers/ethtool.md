**Understanding `ethtool` and Its Usage**

`ethtool` is a powerful command-line utility in Linux that allows users to query and modify network interface card (NIC) parameters. It's especially useful for debugging network issues, fine-tuning NIC performance, and gathering statistics. Below, we'll explore the common options, their usage, and sample outputs to help you get started with `ethtool`.

### **Why Use `ethtool`?**
`ethtool` is essential for network administrators and engineers because it:
1. Provides detailed information about NIC drivers and firmware.
2. Displays and modifies NIC-specific settings like speed, duplex, and offload parameters.
3. Collects and analyzes NIC statistics for troubleshooting.
4. Supports testing NIC hardware.

### **Common `ethtool` Commands**

#### **1. Display Basic NIC Information**
**Command:**
```bash
ethtool eth0
```
**Sample Output:**
```
Settings for eth0:
    Supported ports: [ TP MII ]
    Supported link modes:   10baseT/Half 10baseT/Full
                            100baseT/Half 100baseT/Full
                            1000baseT/Full
    Speed: 1000Mb/s
    Duplex: Full
    Auto-negotiation: on
    Port: Twisted Pair
    Link detected: yes
```
**Description:**
Displays general settings for the `eth0` interface, including supported speeds, link status, and duplex mode.

#### **2. Display NIC Driver and Firmware Information**
**Command:**
```bash
ethtool -i eth0
```
**Sample Output:**
```
driver: e1000e
version: 3.2.6-k
firmware-version: 1.5-1
bus-info: 0000:00:19.0
```
**Description:**
Provides details about the driver, firmware version, and bus information for the `eth0` NIC.

---

#### **3. Display NIC Statistics**
**Command:**
```bash
ethtool -S eth0
```
**Sample Output:**
```
NIC statistics:
     rx_packets: 12345678
     tx_packets: 23456789
     rx_bytes: 987654321
     tx_bytes: 876543210
     rx_errors: 0
     tx_errors: 1
```
**Description:**
Shows detailed NIC statistics, such as transmitted and received packets, bytes, and errors.

---

#### **4. Modify Speed and Duplex Settings**
**Command:**
```bash
sudo ethtool -s eth0 speed 1000 duplex full autoneg on
```
**Description:**
Sets the speed to 1000 Mbps, duplex mode to full, and enables auto-negotiation for the `eth0` interface.

---

#### **5. Display Offload Parameters**
**Command:**
```bash
ethtool --show-offload eth0
```
**Sample Output:**
```
Offload parameters for eth0:
rx-checksumming: on
tx-checksumming: on
scatter-gather: on
tcp-segmentation-offload: on
```
**Description:**
Displays offload settings such as checksumming and segmentation offloading for the NIC.

---

#### **6. Perform Hardware Tests**
**Command:**
```bash
sudo ethtool --test eth0
```
**Sample Output:**
```
The test result is PASS
```
**Description:**
Runs a self-test on the NIC hardware to ensure it is functioning correctly.
